## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845 kernel tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

- Rebased on official LineageOS lineage-21 branch & bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch as of October 2023
- Added first-stage init commits for U compatibility (and future support of retrofit dynamic partitions)
